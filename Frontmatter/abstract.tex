\section*{Abstract}
    The purpose of this thesis is to construct so-called $\gamma$-extended toroidal Lie algebras, which can be understood as a two-variable analogue of untwisted affine Kac-Moody algebras. Ostensibly, these $\gamma$-extended toroidal Lie algebras were were created as a mean of endowing toroidal Lie algebras with Lie bialgebra structures, so that toroidal Lie bialgebras can be recognised as classical limits of so-called \say{affine Yangians} in a certain sense. This necessitates endowing $\gamma$-extended Lie algebras with \textit{non-degenerated} and \textit{invariant} symmetric bilinear forms, a prominent feature of these Lie algebras that will play a crucial role in the constructions carried out in this thesis.
