\section*{Acknowledgements}
    I must firstly acknowledge the invaluable contributions that my advisors, Prof. Dr. Curtis Wendlandt and Prof. Dr. Alex Weekes, have made towards this thesis. Not only were they the ones to give me this problem, but the thesis simply could not have been written without their close following of my progress (and often, even the lack thereof), as well as their many suggestions and advices regarding both proof strategies and presentation. I would also like to thank them for all the mathematics that they have taught and introduced me to throughout the length of my MSc., much of which I had no prior familiarity with. I would also like to express my gratitude towards them, for teaching me how to not just mathematical contents themselves, but also how to actually \textit{do} mathematics. I was not able to appreciate many of their advices in the moment, but with the benefit of hindsight, these advices have become very precious to me.
    
    I would also like to thank Prof. Dr. Steven Rayan, who was my instructor for two of the courses that I was required to take as a part of my MSc., not only for being a wonderful instructor, but also for the many administrative help that he has provided me with over the past two years. I am also grateful for the fact that through him, I was able to become friends with some other graduate students in the Department, namely Mahmud Azam and Kuntal Banerjee. We have had many enjoyable discussions.
