    \texorpdfstring{\Huge On a class of extended toroidal Lie algebras coming from untwisted affine Yangians}

    \todo[inline]{I decided to go with this slightly vague title, which is along the lines suggested by Dr. Weekes. After thinking about it some more, I think any insinuation that our $\gamma$-extended toroidal Lie algebras might resemble any kind of 2-variable analogue of Kac-Moody algebras might be misleading, since that might imply that we are also studying combinatorial structures like root systems and so on in this thesis.}
