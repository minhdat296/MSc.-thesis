    \todo[inline]{Is our construction somehow novel in comparison with the EALAs (of nullity $2$) from the works of Neher et al. ? (Yes, but how ?)}

    \todo[inline]{Explain the terminology "$\gamma$-divergence-zero vector fields". What happens if we replace $\gamma_1 := \gamma$ with $\gamma_m: A \to \bbC$ given by $\gamma_m(f) := -\Res(v^{-m}f)$ (and in particular, what happens when $m = 0$) ?}
